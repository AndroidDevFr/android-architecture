This project hosts each sample app in separate repository branches. For more information, see the `README.md` file in each branch.

### Kotlin samples
| Sample | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [rx-mvvm-dagger](https://github.com/AndroidDevFr/android-architecture/tree/sample-kotlin-rx-mvvm-dagger) | [Model–View–ViewModel (MVVM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) facilitates a separation of development of the graphical user interface from development of the business logic or back-end logic. |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [mvp-light](https://github.com/AndroidDevFr/android-architecture/tree/sample-java-mvp-light) | [Model-View-Presenter (MVP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter) is a derivation of the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern, and is used mostly for building user interfaces. In MVP, the presenter assumes the functionality of the "middle-man". In MVP, all presentation logic is pushed to the presenter.|
